#HOW TO CHECK THE READING TIME OF THE ARTICLES MATCHES WITH THE USERS READING TIME
    #loop untill counter is 3
      #grab an article from news api that matches user interest
      #check the content of the article to determine how long it would take to read
      #check if the reading time is less than the reading time that has been given by the user
        #if the reading time of the article is below or equal of the user:
          #the article gets created and saved in an array
          #the counter goes up by 1
          #loop starts again
        #if the reading time of the article is above the userÂ´s
          #nothing happens
          #loop starts again
    #loop ends when the counter = 3 and thus there are 3 articles in the array
    #the 3 articles in the array get displayed
